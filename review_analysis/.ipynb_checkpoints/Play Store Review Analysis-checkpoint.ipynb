Don't try to make excuses as I've had several friends try their phones at 21:30 at night... same results. Also, not sure if it's you or Dublin bus but sometimes it counts down minutes to arrival on a bus which never appears. Basically these things considered, your app is pointless and need not exist. App deserves -8\n",

First it was showing 20 min to come then after 5 or 7 min I check again it says 35 mins I was like oh ok strange . Then after 5 min I check again the 65 bus not on the list anymore . I run to bus stop and it seem this app played me up . Problem there is not even bus next hour . Next one is 2 hours after . In this cold night and horrible waiting after work :(\n",
